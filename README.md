# MyCalculator and first project :slightly_smiling_face:
In this project I wanted to make something simple just to learn about graphical interface and get myself into Git and GitHub.
I used Python (didn't want to complicate myself too much) and the library Tkinter for the interface. Despite I am very happy with the result and the functionality is
really great, I think the code is a bit chaotic, perhaps because of the null planning I did.  

All advice and help are welcome. :cowboy_hat_face:
